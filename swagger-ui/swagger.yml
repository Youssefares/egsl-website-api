        Note that this is another way to edit user password. The first was PUT /auth/ which
        requires you to know the former password. This endpoint however requires the correct
        authentication headers only, with access-token = a password reset token which is
        sent in the password reset email as part of the redirect link. 
        Optionally you can use this endpoint to reset password by knowing your 
        current_password as well.
        You may only use your password reset token once to reset your password.
